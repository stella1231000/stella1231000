# Website for GitHub profile

This site was generated and added to the repository by the GitHub Copilot assistant.

To publish with GitHub Pages: go to the repository Settings → Pages, set the source to the main branch and the root folder, then save. The site will be available at https://stella1231000.github.io/stella1231000/ (may take a minute).

Customize index.html and styles.css to personalize content, add images in an assets/ folder, or add a CNAME if you want a custom domain.
